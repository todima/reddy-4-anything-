<p><strong>Members:</strong>Todima Preetham reddy-JC467238, Tummala Nithin reddy-JC468552,Vinay Vardhan reddy-jc467099,phanindra reddy-jc468544 </p>

<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
<p>The aim is to redesign the website of TCMC to attract non-member and registered users to become members and to engage them towards administration roles, organising concerts and workshops and also to promote them. The website also targets to increase the sale of tickets to increase the profits. This will help TCMC to get more performers to their stage.</p>

<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>Once the website is relaunched we will measure the success evaluation by measuring the increase in no. of registrations to site which will help TCMC in increasing the no. of events and concerts organised by them. Along with that ticket sale through the website would be another point from which we will measure the success of the website.</p>

<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The main target for TCMC would be the people between the ages of 35-40 years who have interest in any kind of music. As the target is middle age people, the website needs to have a classic design rather than a modern and flashy design. The reason to keep a classic design is that the middle age people would be more familiar towards this kind of designs.</p>
